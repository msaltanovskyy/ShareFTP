# File Transfer Client and Server

This project implements a simple file transfer system using Python's socket programming. It consists of a client and a server that communicate over TCP to send and receive files.

## Overview

- **Server**: Listens for incoming connections, receives a file name from the client, and saves the file sent by the client.
- **Client**: Connects to the server, allows the user to select a file to send, and transmits the file to the server.

## Components

### Server (`server_main.py`)

- **create_socket()**: Initializes the server socket, binds it to an IP address and port, and listens for incoming connections.
- **File Reception**: Accepts a connection from a client, receives the file name, and saves the incoming file data to disk.

### Client (`client_main.py`)

- **create_connection()**: Establishes a connection to the server using the specified IP address and port.
- **file_find()**: Lists available files in a specified directory and allows the user to select a file to send.
- **file_send()**: Sends the selected file to the server after transmitting the file name.

## Usage

1. Start the server by running `server_main.py`.
2. Run the client by executing `client_main.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to connect to the server and select a file to send.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of socket programming

## Notes

- Ensure that the server is running before starting the client.
- Modify the file paths in the code as necessary to match your environment.
